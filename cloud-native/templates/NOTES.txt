WSO2 Observability Solution has now been deployed to your cluster. With the default installion, you can set up 
the minimum deployment for metrics monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
For that please refer above notes. If you can't observe notes above please make sure that you have added 
'--render-subchart-notes' parameter when invoking the helm install command.
Eg: helm install wso2-observability . --render-subchart-notes
You can also view the chart notes after the installation by invoking the helm get notes command.
Eg: helm get notes wso2-observability

If you enable Jaeger you can also enable message tracing and access the Jaeger UI.

If you enable loki stack, please note that the widgets using Loki datasources must be manually configured to use the 
correct datasource due to limitations in the current Grafana Helm charts. Once you install the chart, log widgets will have their datasource set to Promethues.
Please manually change them to loki datasource added during the chart installation.
